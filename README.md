# Project Overview
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In this project, [AutoGluon library](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) is used to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. Tabular Prediction will be used to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition.
